# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. Players take turns to make moves, and the first one to get three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the board is filled without any player achieving this, the game ends in a tie.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Players take turns to input their moves.
3. Enter the row and column where you want to place your symbol (X or O). Rows and columns are numbered from 0 to 2.
4. The game continues until a player wins or the board is filled.

## Example Gameplay

0 1 2
0 | X
1 | O
2 | X
Player X enter your move (row and column): 0 1
